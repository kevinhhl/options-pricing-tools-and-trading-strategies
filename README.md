In this repository, I'll include scripts that can be used for performing analysis on options for spreading/hedging strategies.

## Black-Scholes-Merton Model ("BSM") 
#### BSM Part 1 [<Link\>](https://github.com/kevinhhl/options-pricing-tools-and-trading-strategies/blob/main/Black_Scholes_Merton_Model_Part1_Screening_YF_for_theoretical_edges.ipynb) 
This script will allow us to obtain options chains provided by Yahoo Finance. We will iterate through the chains and then apply BSM to calculate the theoretical values and Greeks. 

#### BSM Part 2 [Work in progress]
In the next update, position analysis will be the focus. We will find ways to present multi-legged spreads in table formats to summarize the common Greeks.

## Implied volatility
